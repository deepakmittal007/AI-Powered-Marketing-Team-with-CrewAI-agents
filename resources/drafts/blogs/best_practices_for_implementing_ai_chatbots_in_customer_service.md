### Importance of Customer Service

Providing excellent customer service helps build trust, retain customers, and differentiate your business from competitors. Efficient customer support can lead to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty.

5. **Monitor Performance**: Continuously monitor chatbot interactions to identify areas for improvement, ensuring the chatbot remains effective and up-to-date.
